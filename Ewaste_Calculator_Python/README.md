#E-waste Calculator

TASK: Create an ewaste calculator program that calculates a users total material usage (plastic, aluminium, copper, total materials) and carbon footprint based on the number of common e-waste items they have used/discarded in their lifetime. Use the provided dataset Ewaste_Product_Breakdown.csv as a key for the material costs and carbon footprint of one of 18 common products.

The calculator could use instructor predetermined quantities for the discarded products or could be interactive with a class appropriate GUI where a user could then calculate their own material usage impact. 

A sample answer is provided in python. Programming language and tasks may be changed to fit course goals.
