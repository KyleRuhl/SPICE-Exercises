##Climatology

Assignment: Create and plot a time series of average yearly maximum and minimum temperatures at a given location.

After plotting, have students analyze the plot- are temperatures increasing or decreasing at your location over time? 
Consider climate change trends vs weather variability. What do you think your plot is telling you? 
What other factors could account for the yearly changes in temperature at your location?


This project incorporates matplotlib, pandas, datetime string conversions, and temperature trends.
The sample response in python uses weather data from the weather station at an airport in Pheonix, Arizona from 1933-2021.

To download a CSV datafile, students should go to https://crt-climate-explorer.nemac.org/
and enter a city of their choice. Then, click on 'Historical Weather Data'. They should then select a station.
Next, press 'Downloads' > 'Download temperature data' and retrieve their CSV file.

The instructor may want to preselect a dataset(s) as some stations have significant gaps in data collection. 
Here we have provided datasets for PHX, NYC, and Anchorage, Alaska.
